## How to make your own fortune database file

(1) Write your fortune items into a file.

(2) Append a percent sign (%) after each item. The percent sign should take a new line. The following is an example.

```
A day for firm decisions!!!!!  Or is it?
%
A few hours grace before the madness begins again.
%
A gift of a flower will soon be made to you.
%
A long-forgotten loved one will appear soon.

Buy the negatives at any price.
%
A tall, dark stranger will have more fun than you.
```

(3) Generate the index file.

```bash
strfile -c % your-fortune-file your-fortune-file.dat
```

(4) Move the fortune file and its index file into `/usr/share/games/fortunes/`.
